# COMP90055_CNN_Emotion_Recognition


This repository contains 4 different folders for 4 different projects:

1. "CNN" contains python scripts for data extraction/processing and training of inception-resnet and mobilenetv2 for recognizing human emotions.
2. "keras-yolo3" contains python scripts for data extraction/processing and training of yolo3 model for recognizing human emotions.
3. "WebProject" contains a file called app which is the code for our webserver where we put the best performing models and wrote 3 human emotion prediction on image REST API for others to use as well. Under WebProject also contains a Dockerfile to build an image which the user can run on their own server if they wish. This webserver also allows users to use the predict REST APIs through a web interface. The user can also login to access more functionalities such as accessing a real time emotion prediction system with their webcam or view a history of all their previous predictions.
4. "Android" contains the android studio project to an android application which has almost identical functionalities as the web server.

Click on each folder to read the "Read Me" page for further details.
