    <string name="home_app_description">
        Human emotion detection is the process of identifying human emotions from a picture. With
        this app, you can upload an image and we will first use a face detection algorithm to determine
        if there is a face(s) present or not and if there is, make a one of 7 emotion predictions:
        Angry, Happy, Sad, Neutral, Disgust, Surprise and Fear as well as a percentage indicating
        how certain the algorithm is on the prediction. The predictions are made with convolutional
        neural networks (CNN) which is currently the state of the art in image processing. The three
        models that are used are Inception-ResNetV1, MobileNet and Yolo3 and each having an accuracy
        of 69%, 67% and 48% respectively. In comparison, humans have an accuracy of 68 +- 5% when it
        comes to emotion prediction from faces according to one study.
        \n\nYou can go to the “upload” tab to start predicting images or view a history of all
        your previous predictions in the “history” tab.
        \n\nHave fun predicting!</string>
