        You can go to the “upload” tab to start predicting images or view a history of all
        your previous predictions in the “history” tab. The app willmake a one of 7 emotion predictions:
        Angry, Happy, Sad, Neutral, Disgust, Surprise and Fear and a certainty. The predictions are made with convolutional
        neural networks which is currently the state of the art in image processing. The three
        models that are used are Inception-ResNetV1, MobileNet and Yolo3 and each having an accuracy
        of 69%, 67% and 48% respectively. In comparison, humans have an accuracy of 68 +- 5% when it
        comes to emotion prediction from faces according to one study.
        \n\nHave fun predicting!</string>
